{"name":"History","content":"<p>Fifty years ago the Halean temple in Tashal felt that it needed to expand the church’s influence beyond the walls of the great city. They sent emissaries to visit the major trading towns in the kingdom; specifically those that were home to a tenant royal or that commanded a crossroads or trading route. The results were not all that the priestesses had hoped for.</p>\n<p>Part of the challenge the church faced was the antagonistic stance of the Laranians and Peonians that already occupied these towns. In places like Kiban, the delegation was flatly refused and its members verbally abused. In others, the priestesses were informed that the town already possessed a brothel and had no use for another. It seemed that the self‐sufficient folk of Kaldor’s towns didn’t appreciate the garish sights and lewd practices of a “foreign religion.”</p>\n<p>In Getha the Baron was not interested in their pleas, only their gifts. He waved off the counsels of the Laranians and told the Haleans “if you can find a place that doesn’t bother anyone and pay your taxes on time, you can labor and prosper like everyone else.” No one had ever accused Baron Indama of eloquence. In years since, the family joke was that their great‐uncle’s bishopric was bought with Halean gold. Ignoring the Baron’s crass manner, the priestesses started the process of establishing a temple in the village.</p>\n<p>Since building a temple would have been prohibitively expensive, one of Halea’s faithful, a litigant named Quiribor, sold the church one of his unused buildings. Sitting on the keep’s square, the structure had been a bonded warehouse. A bit cramped and full of drafts, it was a bargain for the price. Over the years, the stark exterior of the building has been softened with climbing vines and the deft application of paint to the stone work. It is now a colorful landmark on the Silver Way</p>\n<h3>Description</h3>\n<p>The Halean temple’s interior has seen better days. Astute worshipers may notice that the tapestries in the halls are a bit faded and the rooms are decorated in an old fashioned style but the temple’s staff puts every effort into maintaining the goddess’ presence in the hundred. In addition to the seven priestesses, the temple houses four corathar (acolytes) and four solithar (guardsmen).</p>\n<p>Getha’s congregation is small but Mistress Dybrine, the Aramia, works hard to expand her influence by attracting newcomers or former worshippers to the temple. The goddess’ congregation is separated into three circles, depending on their piety and their initiation into the mysteries of the church. Because the Outer Circle is open to anyone who can afford a slight donation, the church feels that the true worshippers belong to the Middle and Inner Circles of initiates.</p>\n<p>The worshippers of the Inner Circle celebrate the goddess in all her aspects. These members often speak of catching glimpses of the goddess at the height of sexual climax and of the soul cleansing acts that they participate in during a shesneala. As in most religions, this circle is the smallest. In Getha, only the physician [21], the litigant [24], and the apothecary [22] stand in the Inner Circle of the goddess’ worship.</p>\n<p>The step between the Inner Circle and Middle Circle is an important and philosophical one. The Middle Circle members tend to be more down‐to‐earth. They are interested in the goddess for the economic and financial benefit that membership in the temple brings. Nowhere is this truer than in Getha, where the conservative worshippers are hesitant to abandon their inhibitions and participate in the public (or at least group) rites of Tania. They prefer to follow the Princess of Enterprise and use the temple as a social club for its business contacts and investment capital.</p>\n<p>The Middle Circle of the Getha Temple has almost ten members. The whitesmith, Shositiri, is a regular member of the weekly service and the Andin clan has been rising in the temple, since the success of their salt works at Sezaze. Mistress Dybrine has also been working diligently to persuade the mason [16] to show more devotion and has hinted that the temple might be able to assist him in pursuing a contract to add a new stone tower to Elmeze manor. The members of the Sermel, Berma, and Darion clans tithe but have little interest in attending the monthly high mass. With this attitude in mind, Mistress Dybrine has instructed Mistress Morgrenë to expand the economic message in the weekly shesneala. These celebrations now limit the erotic arts and concentrate on finance. This shift has helped draw some of the more conservative members of the community back to the church.</p>\n<p>Despite her efforts, the Aramia has not been able to raise much interest among the tradesmen in the western part of the hundred. Mistress Dybrine is planning to buy a pavilion for a tour of the manors west of the Fethryn River. The general attitude was summed up when Ledis Berma, the innkeeper of Hyzevel, commented, “I haven’t seen my cousin without her clothes on in forty years and I’m not traveling two days to see how she’s grown.”</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"LJc1oOgukvummfb8":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":200000},"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.bw5TwDgQvYk2RXF1"},"cf":{"id":"temp_r1dd5f4svq","path":"Getha#/CF_SEP/Temple of Halea","color":"#000000"}},"_id":"JXSNq0sUpHGd3BBD"}

Last winter she was horrified to learn of a torrid romance between her daughter Lysella and one of the Baron's squires, Gladyk Onaret. The Baron swiftly dismissed the boy, despite his family's lengthy and honorable service to the Indama clan, and sent Lysella to live in the family's hunting lodge at Emerule. Sir Chimin felt that the remote manor would serve to keep their 16 year old daughter away from any entanglements that might embarrass the family. Lysella's fling with a squire, and the scion of a vassal family at that, was the height of youthful misjudgment.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text\">To solve this problem, the Baroness has been subtly canvassing the kingdom's nobility for suitable husbands.

Lady Myrtis knows that dragging Scina Dariune to the chapel would be nice, but there are so many clamoring for his hand that the price is certain to be too dear. This process of elimination leaves the Earl of Vemion's son, Urian, as the only suitable man in the kingdom.

Its visitors are merchants traveling the Silver Way. The town represents the last bit of civilization that travelers will see until they reach Pedwar, another two weeks of hard walking.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>The village of Getha is ancient. Located at a bend in the Getha Run, there has been a fortification at Getha since trade caravans began traveling the Silver Way. During the Migration Wars, King Medrik won a battle here that would set the stage for his momentous victory at Noneth. During the pre-Kaldor period, Getha became a thriving town. The Serelindians strengthened the existing fortifications to command the major import/export route along the Silver Way.</p>\n<p>In 240, Gundolf of Gardiren began work on a large stone keep at Getha. The keep was built of Nephen granite and was 70 feet (22 m) square. Each corner of the keep is anchored with a large square tower that rises to over 125 feet. The walls of the keep are 15 feet thick in the basement and taper to 7.5 feet thick at the tops of the towers.</p>\n<p>In 372 and then again in 437, the keep was razed by war and fire. Each time the lord rebuilt his keep and made the holding stronger than it was before. Completely reconstructed in 440 TR, the new keep boasted a strong square keep with towers at each corner.</p>\n<p>Getha’s finest hour was in 602 when forces of the Usurper besieged the keep. The enemy summoned siege engines from Tashal and Kiban and barraged the keep for almost seven weeks. Again and again, the enemy’s soldiers attacked, finally managing to breach the outer defenses in early Savor.</p>\n<p>The defenders rallied and drove them back out of the bailey. Savage fighting took place in the smoldering remains of the village as the enemy counterattacked and retook the outer walls but the keep remained in the hands of the King’s men. The enemy attempted to negotiate a settlement but, although food was running out, the defenders were confident that they could hold out until aid reached them from Gardiren.</p>\n<p>The enemy resorted to undermining the walls. Sinking a mineshaft under the southern wall, the Usurper’s forces set fire to the foundations using barrels filled with pig fat. A section of the wall collapsed and the defenders retreated into the great hall, still refusing to surrender. The siege lasted another twenty days before a relief force from Gardiren arrived.</p>\n<p>By the time the siege was lifted, only twenty defenders remained able to walk. Their names and deeds are recorded in a tapestry that covers the wall in the great hall. The Baron rebuilt the damaged section, adding a gatehouse to strengthen the defenses.</p>\n<p>In 642, Ioin Indama was made Sheriff of Neph. To commemorate this event, he commissioned the construction of a guest hall in the keep’s bailey. Called Ioin’s Hall, this building houses guests and a large banquet hall.</p>\n<p>The hundred is still very much on the frontier. Gargûn swarms in 704 and 718 caused minimal damage but have had a lasting impression on the minds of the inhabitants. The Taelda tribes have been quiet for years but the recent activity at the settlement at Naniom Bridge may change this at a moment’s notice.</p>\n<h2>Government</h2>\n<p>Getha is the main settlement in Fethael Hundred. Primarily a trading town, this village serves as the major market in the area as well as providing services to the traders and caravans that transit the Silver Way.</p>\n<p>The Baron of Getha is Sir Chimin Indama, tenant royal and Lord High Sheriff of Neph. The Baron is an active man in his late forties and is a keen horseman and huntsman. He was a champion jouster in his youth but is now satisfied to watch his sons and nephews compete for the family’s honor while he hunts and talks about past glories with his friends.</p>\n<p>Sir Chimin is a conscientious man, though one not noted for his mental agility, and takes his duties as Baron seriously. As an obedient and loyal servant of the King, he applies Royal Law to the letter, taking no account of circumstance or politics. He makes a point of visiting his family and vassals on a regular basis, a task that often keeps him far from home.</p>\n<p>Now that his son and heir Harapa has come of age, Chimin has resolved to focus on ensuring the future of his family. Sir Chimin is far from bored now that he’s delegated some of his Sheriff’s duties to Sir Harapa. Harapa has relieved him of the burden of constantly traveling from one political dinner to another and Chimin is using the spare change he finds in his privy purse to travel throughout the eastern part of the kingdom arranging a suitable marriage for his daughter, the Lady Lysella. Sir Chimin’s wife of 25 years, Lady Myrtis (nee Curo), governs the keep with a firm but gentle hand in his absence.</p>\n<p>Sir Harapa is a young knight, being only 24 years old, but his prospects are the brightest. As mentioned previously, Sir Harapa Indama has recently assumed some of the duties of Sheriff of Neph for his father. Sir Chimin has given him the responsibility of visiting the manors throughout the shire, as the Sheriff must do at least twice a year. Harapa is also charged with maintaining the keep at Bidow, a task that is accompanied by a royal stipend. The Sheriff’s duties require Harapa’s presence in Tashal at least one month every quarter but he insists on returning to Getha as soon as his responsibilities permit.</p>\n<p>Two years ago, Sir Harapa married Udine Elendsa, the niece of King Miginath. He and Udine have been busy since the births of their two children over the last 18 months. The scions to the Indama title, Dysle and Halene, remain at Getha under the care of their nursemaid while Udine accompanies Harapa in his duties. To help guide his son through some of the decisions required of a Constable, Sir Chimin has enlisted the aid of Sir Eadwin Lournay, the lord of Drilen, to counsel and mentor his son.</p>\n<p>Sir Shorisir Ewesar is the Constable of the Keep [see 2-6 on the plan of the keep]. He is the distant cousin of his clanhead, who holds the manor of Derym in Grimuld Hundred from the Baron. Sir Shorisir is comfortable in his office and has established himself as a level headed and cool leader.</p>\n<p>Sir Shorisir has been a vassal knight of the Barons of Getha for the last 30 years. He began his service as a squire of Sir Lors, the current Baron’s father, and then performed as a forester and knight-attendant when Sir Lors acted as Sheriff of Neph. After Sir Chimin became the Baron, Sir Shorisir was selected to replace the retiring Constable of Getha Keep.</p>\n<p>Over the last 24 years, Shorisir has governed the keep with a gentle hand. He rules the manor with the assistance of a small advisory council and has never felt the need to raise his voice or make demands of the merchants, farmers, and serfs of Getha or its subordinate manors. His duties include governing the town and Getha’s vassal manors. A council made up of the litigant Shalas Quiribor [24], the reeve Tazar Tyun [42], and the Chaplain of the Keep Sotrin Rhythal [20] advises Sir Shorisir.</p>\n<p>The Constable commands the 20-man garrison of the keep. This company of light foot is charged with safeguarding the baronial treasury, which is held in the keep, and helping the Laranian knights from Jenkald maintain a watch over the Silver Way between Getha and the crossroads in the Krista Forest. During wartime the garrison is responsible for local security. Sir Shorisir owes one knight (himself) and three yeomen to the Baron’s war band during the muster.</p>\n<h2>Economics</h2>\n<p>The Getha chapter of the Mangai includes masters of each guild represented in the Fethael Hundred. This group serves to regulate guilded trade within the hundred and to promote Fethael's goods and services beyond its borders. It is governed by an Executive Council of seven members, each elected by the membership for two year terms.</p>\n<p>Getha has experienced an economic recession since merchants started barging khuzan goods downriver from the Naniom Bridge. The days when huge mule trains filled Getha Commons and coin was plentiful are quickly passing into story as the manor and its village refocuses its industry on providing goods and services for the local population. Locally produced goods fill the market place and the few exotic items usually come from Uldien or Gardiren rather than Azadmere and Thay.</p>\n<h3>Imports</h3>\n<p>Despite the breeding efforts of the ostlers of Getha, the hundred still imports horses and mules. The market for mules is steady, if seasonal. Trained pack mules are in the highest demand, followed by mules trained to pull carts and small wagons for the grain trade. Most, if not all, of these animals are imported from Vemionshire.</p>\n<p>The hundred has no mining and must import all of the minerals used by local craftsmen. Copper, iron, and tin ingots are imported from Azadmere in exchange for wheat. Since khuzan trade has been limited, some craftsmen are forced to purchase metal from nearby Balim and Oselshires. This trade comes at a high cost since these must be paid for in cash. Salt comes from the mines near Nenda, barged down the Selene River to Uldien and then packed by mule cart up the Silver Way.</p>\n<h3>Exports</h3>\n<p>The forests that surround Fethael Hundred grow the types of hardwoods that make the best charcoal. Most of the manors contribute to the trade and the smell of woodsmoke is thick in the dales. The Asaka clan controls the charcoal trade, sending most of their product south to Balimshire’s smelters.</p>\n<p>Fur is another forest product that is exported by the hundred’s manors. Most of the nobles of the Balim, Thel, and Osel shires wear furs from the dark Kanir or Kirsta forests. The younger knights and most of the huntsmen wear wolflined cloaks with hoods to ward off the cold rain. Bear pelts are prized as rugs. Those with heavier purses prefer to spend their pennies on ermines and minx found in the Sorkin foothills.</p>\n<p>The hundred has always maintained a steady trade in herbs for spices and medicines. The Apothecary of Getha has perfected a process for refining the root of the mandrake into an amazing curative drug. He also exports fragrant herbs to Tashal for use in oils and soaps.</p>\n<h3>Taxes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Hawking:</strong> 5% of goods value</li>\n<li><strong>Bonding:</strong> 2% of goods value per month</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Religion</h2>\n<p>The religious climate of Getha is similar to the rest of Kaldor. Services for Larani are held in the keep’s chapel. Peonian and Halean rites are held in their temples. Most villagers worship Peoni. Many craftsmen pay lip service to Halea. The law states that worship of Agrik, Morgath and Naveh is punishable by death but it has been so long since anyone has been accused of “devil worshiping” that these are used as stories to frighten children. Other religions are tolerated but not encouraged.</p>\n<h2>Current Events</h2>\n<p>The hundred has always had its share of Taelda raids and gargûn hunting parties nearer the Bridge. The gargûn swarms of 718 are still fresh in the memories of the people and they are vigilant, indeed some are paranoid, about the chance of attack. Recently, however, well-armed raiders have been harassing traders and isolated farmsteads and the taprooms are full of gossip trying to predict when the Baron and the knights of Jenkald will ride out to give the “devil riders” battle.</p>\n<p>Since the Baron has established an official presence at Naniom Bridge, the Taelda tribes in the area have become restless and the region has become very dangerous.</p>\n<h2>Grain Fair</h2>\n<p>The kingdom’s wheat is harvested in Larane and wagonloads of grain begin rumbling north on the Silver Way to Getha. While most of central Kaldor’s grain is barged upstream to the Naniom Bridge, there are still grain merchants that gather in Getha for the march east to the mountains. The collected grain joins the caravan of luxury goods moving east from the great market of Tashal in mid-Azura.</p>\n<p>The village holds a grain fair on the village common in mid-Azura to take advantage of this occurrence. The people of the hundred flock to trade their grain and livestock for the luxury goods of Tashal and the exotic west in a month long extended market. Silks brought from far off Melderyn, furs from Orbaal, and the fine crafts of Kanday compete for the hard earned coins of the people. There is no tournament held in conjunction with the Grain Fair but the Baroness sponsors a bardic competition on the 15th of Azura that starts after Soratir is said in the keep’s chapel.</p>\n<p>Harpers and minstrels compete side by side in an open competition of storytelling and song. The theme for each entry is the history of Fethael Hundred and, by extension, the Indama clan. The best entrant is rewarded with a silver medallion engraved with the portcullis of the Indamas. Songs or stories that are deemed to ridicule the distinguished service of the Indamas or belittle the heroism of the inhabitants of the hundred are viewed in quite a different light; the performers are given the opportunity to reflect upon their mistakes as they spend a ten-day in the stocks.</p>\n<h2>Spring Fair</h2>\n<p>The Spring Fair is held from 14 – 17 Kelen. Historically timed to coincide with the arrival of trade caravans traveling to Tashal, the fair’s scheduled events start whether the khuzan traders have arrived or not. The Fair’s Royal Charter allows the Baron open the fair on the 14th and continue for three days after first caravan of traders arrives. The fair features goods from Azadmere as well as a local tournament (see Getha 28 for details). This fair is the start of the hundred’s trading season. Khuzan traders and buyers from Tashal, eager to make the first bargains of the season, fill the town. Khuzan weapons and metal implements are traded for grains, cloth and horses. The people of the hundred are perhaps the greatest beneficiaries of the fair, as it brings exotic khuzan items and manufactured goods to the town that would otherwise be prohibitively expensive to import.</p>\n<h2>The Manor</h2>\n<p>The manor itself is not large, only 1,660 acres, but has been well managed and is fertile (Land Quality 1.10). The fields and orchards are all located on the western side of the village. Although the area around the manor is secure, most of the villagers loathe foraging or grazing their stock east of the Silver Way because “it’s the wilderness.”</p>\n<p>Typical of Fethael Hundred, the villagers plant a large proportion of hardy grains and raise swine and cattle. Barley and rye are grown in addition to wheat. Early, hard frosts limit the farmers’ ability to raise less weather resistant crops and animals. Swine and cattle are the most common livestock, filling the hundred’s larders with smoked pork, cheese, and beef.</p>\n<p>Getha has its own mill and several metal smiths. The importance of these craftsmen is measured not only in the service they provide to the local villagers. To their families and guilds they are more important as representatives on the Mangai. A handful of families and, therefore a handful of people, dominate most if not all of the guilds in the hundred. For example, all the millers are Etines and all the salters are from the Andin clan. The Berma, Haral, and Cybela clans have likewise staked powerful political positions in the Mangai Hall by carefully controlling the appointment of journeymen and masters inside their areas of control. Other clans have a significantly smaller presence, usually because of marriages or patronage of a larger, more established clan.</p>\n<p>The village craftsmen provide goods and services for the hundred and any passing merchants. The concentration of craftsmen enables the village to export manufactured goods to the rest of the hundred. When the village manages to have a surplus, enterprising merchants will form their own caravan and sell the hundred’s smoked hams and dry ciders in Tashal. This steady demand has enabled Getha to survive the current economic down turn.</p>\n<p>Within the region, the hundred’s merchants and craftsmen are exploring new markets to try to make up for the lost revenue. Getha makes a tidy little profit exporting linen and horses. Bainin Darion [26] buys linen thread and undyed cloth from the manors of the hundred. The thread is woven by his wife into fine linen that is exported to dyers in Balimshire. The cloth is used to make clothing for the local merchants and tradesmen, which Bainin sells from his shop in the town.</p>\n<p>Both Stanil Darion [D] and Erebel Sermel [34] breed horses for sale. The Kirsta Forest Horses are the result of crossbreeding between the huge Oselshire warhorses and a smaller, more agile breed imported from Kanday through Melderyn by Baron Chimin’s great-grandsire. Ostlers have refined the Kirsta Horse through the years to suit a variety of needs. Only Stanil can sell warhorses and then only by special license. Erebel has a broader market for his palfreys and hunters bred for riding by the gentle folk.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"LJc1oOgukvummfb8":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":400000},"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.0ZQKYbilRavGw3nU"},"cf":{"id":null,"path":"Getha","color":"#000000"}}}

{"name":"Feast Of Halane","content":"<p>The major festival for the Halean Church is the Feast of Halane. This holiday is celebrated from 1 – 7 Halane. Despite the conservative demeanor of most of the people in Fethael Hundred, few can resist a good party. Everyone is welcome but revelers are expected to make donations to Haleaʹs temple. Only worshippers of the Middle and Inner Circle can participate in the high mass on the seventh day.</p>\n<p>The festival is held on the village square, beginning each day with a feast at midday and ending with a revel that lasts until dawn. The feast includes a wide variety of foods and drink (many with stimulant or aphrodisiac properties.) While the festival‐goers eat and drink, scantily clad priestesses perform Eleri Plays portraying Haleaʹs grace and her fury. Each theatrical production is centered on the theme of the day.</p>\n<p>The names of the festival days come from the names of the seven handmaidens of Halea.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Halane: The Day of Welcome ‐ Selina (Princess of Abundance). The festival begins with a parade around the town. The priestesses ride gilded chariots and throw coins and small tokens to the crowds. The temple throws open its doors for all to enter and sample the luxury of Halea. Businessmen believe that passing through the temple’s doors brings luck in the coming year.</li>\n<li>Halane: The Day of Endeavor ‐ Elomia (Princess of Enterprise). Traditionally, tradesmen renew yearly contracts on the second day of the feast. The afternoon is devoted to the choosing of apprentices and the promotion of young men to journeymen. It is rare in the small hundred for a journeyman to become a master but, when it does happen, his promotion is celebrated with a special toast and a private service in the temple.</li>\n<li>Halane: The Day of the Joyous Song ‐ Dulcia (Princess of Harmony). The afternoon features an open‐ air concert and much dancing. Halean priestesses sing solo and in choir. Dancing is held around a bonfire that is lit at the end of the square. Those that imbibe too heavily have been known to dance their way into the river but, so far, no one has perished from the sudden dunking.</li>\n<li>Halane: The Day of Retribution ‐ Sardura (Princess of the Golden Wrath). Haleans celebrate this as day of retribution against oath breakers and cheats. The festivities start with a gladiator tournament (a plaisance) and an archery competition. Mock trials are sometimes held to satirize public figures.</li>\n<li>Halane: The Day of Chance – Thalia (Princess of Fortune). Games of chance run rampant on this day of the festival. The temple sponsors a footrace around the town. Money bet on this day is said to double if you are in favor with Halea. The day’s Eleri Play reminds practitioners that the goddess is fickle and no one should press their luck.</li>\n<li>Halane: The Day of Indulgence ‐ Glaopea (Princess of the Feast). This is the final public day of the festival. The Halean temple provides a luscious feast for everyone. The food is tasty and plentiful. Barrels of fine cider and mead are tapped and everyone may drink freely until the barrels are empty.</li>\n<li>Halane: The Day of Golden Excess – Tania (Princess of the Brief Ecstasy). On the seventh day the temple is closed to the public and practitioners of the Middle and Inner Circles participate in a special high mass. The festival culminates with an Eleri Play, special songs, and dances. The townsfolk consider it impolite to stand in the square and stare at the temple as the sounds of the drums go on and on...</li>\n</ol>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"LJc1oOgukvummfb8":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":600000},"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.2iJHKnYYo04cvL2l"},"cf":{"id":"temp_r1dd5f4svq","path":"Getha#/CF_SEP/Temple of Halea","color":"#000000"}},"_id":"eSXbCANJwgjkkcNr"}

{"_id":"fEEu6P61ggAyvldc","name":"Getha Village","content":"<p>The most striking fact about Getha village is the small number of clan names. Almost all of the people belong to one of a very small set of families. No matter that the clans have intermarried, individuals will be referred to as “an Andin” or “a Berma” their entire lives. Most of this is good-natured jesting but some families do not get along.</p>\n<p>There is a simmering distrust between the Berma and Haral families. No one remembers why, really. There was something to do with an engagement that was broken off at the last minute when a Haral accused his Berma fiancée of being unfaithful and trying to trick him into rearing someone else’s bastard. The Berma clan denied the charge and for a few years the woods between Denwald (where the Berma hail from) and Drilen (the ancestral home of the Haral) were full of ambushes, stolen animals, and bad blood. Sir Chimin’s father finally settled the dispute but the mistrust between the clans lingers to this day.</p>\n<p>The craftsmen and free farmers of the village pride themselves on the stone houses they live in. These stout, neat homes of dressed field stone are one or two stories tall and have strong wood shingled roofs. Tall walls, covered with climbing plants and flowers, surround all of these houses and decorate the narrow gravel streets.</p>\n<p>The Silver Way, the main trading route of the eastern part of the kingdom, is a graveled road, wide enough for two wagons to pass each other. The roadway is sloped to let the frequent rains run off and the eastern side of the road has a ditch to carry off the water. The four foot deep ditch frequently has water (and other things) in it and buildings on the eastern side of the Silver Way have short, wide bridges to cross this deep obstacle.</p>\n<p>The houses of the village’s unfree populace are mostly split timber with thatched roofs, the walls between the timbers being made from wattle and daub. The other side is used as a byre for the animals. Because of the number of roof fires in the village, the Constable has decreed that all chimneys be made of stone, rather than the more usual mud and stick.</p>\n<h2>Map Key</h2>\n<p>Refer to the

{"name":"Shesneala","content":"<p>The weekly shesneala is an evening service and is open to members of the Middle Circle and Inner Circle of the Temple. Held in the Chamber of Tania, the celebration starts with a light meal. Members of the congregation mingle and discuss the activities and events of the town while sipping wine and eating small dainties. The service begins with the hypnotic beat of drums and a procession of corathar leading the priestesses into the chamber. The worshippers form a circle around the Aramia, join hands, and sing the opening hymn. As the corathar accompany the service with flutes and drums, the ring of worshippers sways in time with the music while the priestess in the center performs a ritual dance.</p>\n<p>Once they finish the hymn, the celebrant remains standing and the worshippers sit in a circle on the floor or on pillows. The priestess leads the congregation as they recite a litany asking for the goddess’ blessing. After the litany, the Aramia or one of the priestesses gives an allegorical reading on a specific topic or aspect of the goddess. Once the reading is complete, a final hymn ends the celebration.</p>\n<p>The hymn is the cue for the solithar to carry in sideboards laden with drinks and finger foods, each specially prepared by the cook Milycia. Not all of the tidbits are drugged but the food is notable because their ingredients have aphrodisiac properties. During this time the priestesses move around the room, discussing the allegory or talking about business with members of the congregation. Some of the worshippers adjourn to the Chamber of Elomia and continue their discussions while others retire downstairs for private devotions with a corathar or priestess.</p>\n<p>The monthly shesneala has the same structure but there is more of everything. The ceremony includes more hymns, a longer liturgy, and more dancing. Another example is that the allegory is often accompanied by a short play, acted out by some of the parishioners and a priestess. After the service, worshippers tend to stay in the Chamber of Tania and participate in dancing, food, and intercourse ‐ verbal and physical.</p>\n<p>Worshipers enter the temple through a pair of large, brass plated doors. The plates depict scenes of the pleasures that await the faithful in Corilsea, the Halean paradise.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The antechamber is decorated with anatomically correct statues of six of Halea’s handmaidens. The statue of the handmaiden Selina (Princess of Abundance) is in the Chamber of Selina [2].</li>\n<li>The Chamber of Selina is open to the public. The chamber is beautifully appointed, with comfortable furniture and simple morsels at the sideboards and small tables. Incense fills the room. Functionally the room is like a club’s meeting room, where members discuss contacts and share gossip.</li>\n<li>The kitchen is at one end of the hall. A large, locked, cabinet of wines and cordials fill the other alcove. The kitchen is small but immaculately clean. The servants sleep here. The cook, Milycia, came to the temple with the Aramia over 15 years ago. She makes regular shopping trips to Tashal for special herbs and additives. She has gained a nickname among the temple insiders of “Mother Love” for her aphrodisiac‐ based hors d’oeuvres.</li>\n<li>This room, accessible only through the Aramia’s chambers, is the temple’s secret meeting room. Sensitive documents are stored here, since only the Aramia has the key to the door at the top of the stairs.</li>\n<li>The “watch room” is available to celebrants that enjoy observing through peepholes, rather than partaking, in the activities. As the room is reachable only through the Chamber of Elomia, only members of the temple’s Inner and Middle Circles may use this room.</li>\n<li>The corathar’s quarters are small rooms; each dominated by a large bed. All three of these rooms are currently occupied. Private worship sessions are available for a donation, usually 10 ‐ 50d.</li>\n<li>One of Halea’s “plain pennies”, Derien the Ralithina (Mistress of Silk and Gold) is obsessed with facts and figures. A born‐accountant, Derien spends long, lonely hours working on the temple’s accounts and financial projections.</li>\n<li>This staircase is as far as anyone of the Outer Circle is allowed. The walls are painted with murals of the goddess engaged in mind‐boggling contortions, each more fantastic than the last as they lead a worshipper up the stairs. Under the stairs is a closet where instruments and larger items are stored. The rear courtyard houses the privy.</li>\n<li>Celebrations in the Chamber of Tania (Princess of Brief Ecstasy) are open to members who have attained at least the Middle Circle of the goddess’ favor. The rituals of the weekly and monthly shesneala (the lay masses) are held in this room. Aside from the musicians’ platform in the corner, there is no permanent furniture in this room. Silken pillows and low couches are scattered throughout the room. The elaborate decor, the wine and spirits, the incense and music, and the fine imported delicacies all contribute to the central theme of sensual, erotic, pleasure.</li>\n<li>The Chamber of Elomia (Princess of Enterprise) is open to the Middle Circle and Inner Circle of worshipers. Decorated in dark leather and solid furniture, this is a businesslike room. The temple library is housed here, a collection that contains economic as well as sexual and religious works. Here, members get financial counseling and have a place where they can hear information about business opportunities such as pending legal actions, investment opportunities, and the availability of franchises. Inner Circle worshipers come here to pursue purely business concerns, away from the distractions of the Chamber of Tania.</li>\n<li>The solithar sleep here when they are not assisting the priestesses in devotions.</li>\n<li>Games of chance are available in the Chamber of Thalia (Princess of Fortune.) Card games and dice are popular, with large amounts of cash changing hands on nightly basis. The temple takes a 10% commission of all the bets – to honor the goddess and cover their expenses. Like the rest of this floor of the temple, a person must have attained the Middle Circle before they may partake in the pleasures of this chamber.</li>\n<li>The Aramia’s chamber is often the site of very delicate, high level meetings. A huge, circular bed dominates the room. Few have sampled the celestial delights of its warm silk and fur covers. Those that have maintain the discretion Halea demands of her truest adherents. The current Aramia (High Priestess) Dybrine is a short, buxom fifty‐something woman. She is energetic, playful, and a master politician. She likes to tantalize the craftsmen in the village with glimpses of her creamy flesh at the moment most calculated to shock them.</li>\n<li>Forli the Kilina (Mistress of Discipline) has spies everywhere. She is the Aramiaʹs lover and all of the Corathar report directly to her. Forli knows of the perfumer’s wiles and the litigant’s coercions but has filed them away for future use. Forli is a young (22) black haired woman who isn’t shy when it comes to distracting people and getting them to talk.</li>\n<li>Haelinë the Lorsina (Mistress of Golden Banquet) is a worldly, middle‐ aged woman from Thay. There are so few devotees in the hundred that only the temple staff and the village physician attend the temple’s monthly shesneala ceremonies. Haelinë enjoys making the physician the center of the ceremony, as she maintains that his Thardic training makes him “equal to any of the priestesses” in the goddess’ service. Mistress Haelinë is also responsible for planning and organizing the Feast of Halane.</li>\n<li>Morgrenë is the Yishiva (Mistress of Harmonies) and is in charge of the weekly Shesneala services. Unlike the monthly ceremonies, these are quiet affairs that focus on the economic, rather than sexual, aspects of Halean worship.</li>\n<li>Mistress Jundael is only eighteen but she is a prodigy. As the Desilea (Mistress of Luxuriant Page), her abilities outshine many more experienced priestesses. She was sent to Getha from Tashal out of jealousy. She is responsible for the Chamber of Selina and is considered the hostess of the Getha Temple. She is always on hand to meet the celebrants as they enter the temple. Few can view this slender, fair‐skinned red head and think to turn away from the Goddess.</li>\n</ol>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"LJc1oOgukvummfb8":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":400000},"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.6xlWtZwPRpTdIAFf"},"cf":{"id":"temp_r1dd5f4svq","path":"Getha#/CF_SEP/Temple of Halea","color":"#000000"}},"_id":"kO0lH5yWGGQSpIPF"}
