# HârnWorld Location Module: Getha Keep

Getha Keep is a "Location Module" for the Foundry VTT system. This location module
is designed to depict the Getha Keep in the far northeast of the Kingdom of Kaldor, on
the island of Hârn in the [HârnWorld](https://columbiagames.com/harnworld/) fantasy
setting; however, this manor could be adapted to exist anywhere in any fantasy setting.

Although designed for use with the [HârnMaster](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/hm3)
system, this module is mostly system-agnostic.  Detailed descriptions of the actors
has been provided in journal entries to facilitate conversion to other game systems.

Getha is the largest village in Fethael Hundred. The seat and ancestral home of the
Indama clan, this village also provides goods and services to Silver Way caravans
and travelers.
